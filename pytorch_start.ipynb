    "I will be taching myself how to use the `PyTorch` library in Python and how I can use this library instead of tensorflow. I think `PyTorch` would be better for me to practice Python rather than tensor flow because of how `torch` makes use of object oriented programming while creating models. I will be learning how to deal with tensors which are the backbone of `PyTorch`.\n",
